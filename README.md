# Craigslist-Vehicle-Scraper
Quick vehicle scraper for craigslist, mostly unfinished. Most of Craigslists ads seem to be spam/dealers anyway now.

Uses Selenium and VPIC vehicle db to grab make model, etc from VIN.
Quite unfinished/ dirty code. Gave up on after finding the quality of craigslist ads have actually gone down since they introduced a 5$ fee to post cars now. Decent POC though. Was planning to do some analytics on car data over time.
